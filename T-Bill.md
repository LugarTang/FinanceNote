# T-Bills

US debt instruments with maturities of one year or less

Low-risk investment with a broad and liquid secondary market

T-bills are free of default risk (违约风险) and generally have lower interest rate than corporate issues of comparable securities

Interest earned on Treasuries is exempt from state and local taxes

## T-Bill Auction

A **T-Bill auction** refers to the process by which the U.S. Treasury Department sells Treasury bills (T-Bills) to investors.

The face value of a T-Bill is the amount received by holder on the maturity date

Auction participant submit bids immediately before the auction

- Investors submit menus of competitive bids by size and yield.
- Primary dealers are required to participate in every auction.
- Small (≤ 5 million) non-competitive bids are always accepted.

Treasury accepts the lowest yields up until the announced quantity is allotted in full and rejects the remaining bids.

- Market clearing (市场出清) rate: stop-out bids at the highest winning yield are prorated.

Auction results are released within minutes of the closing time.

- All successful bidders receive the bond at the same stop-out price

when bid, high rate's denominator is face value while investment rate has denominator as purchase price

**Discount Yield Method**

Annualised based on 360 day year, using face value as investment

$$
\text{Discount Yield}:=\frac{FV-P}{FV}\times\frac{360}{M}.
$$

But investment rate is calculated as a 365 day year.

**The Investment Yield Method**

$$
\text{Investment Yield}:=\frac{FV-P}P\times\frac{365\text{ or }366}{M}.
$$
